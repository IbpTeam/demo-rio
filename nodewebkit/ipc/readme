To implement ipc your own, you should realize interfaces called invoke and notify of IPC at least just like ipc-dbus.js done.

Interface definition:
{
  package: package's name [optional] -> String
  service: service's name -> String
  path: object's path [optional] -> String
  remote: service for remote device or not, defalut is "false" -> String: "true"/"false"
  interfaces: [
    {
      name: interface name -> String
      in: [type of perameters -> String] -> Array
      out: type of return value -> String
    } -> Object
  ] -> Array
}

When finish define your interface, use generator to get correponding Proxy and Stub.
e.g. nodejs generator.js $your_interface_file
